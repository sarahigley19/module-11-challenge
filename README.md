# Note Taker Starter Code
I was asked to create a note app using Express.js

##  Project Description
This has been my least favorite project to date. I had so much trouble with the folders, running the terminal and deploying to Render. But I think I got it after a great tutoring appointment. The good news is that I am learning a lot. But Express is not my favorite.
